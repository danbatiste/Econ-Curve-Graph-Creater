# Econ Curve Graph Creator

This program graphs economics curves. I used this one to make graphics for projects in my econ classes, and also to help me visualize certain problems. The graphs and the functions it can handle are a lot more complex than the other market curve grapher, and I mostly used this for the latter half of the class when it got tougher and more advanced.
